  ## Installation
  You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your computer. 
  
  Once you clone the repo for this app, in your terminal, navigate to the `/professional-readme-generator` directory and run the command `npm install`. When that is finished installing the node-packages, then run the command `node app` to start the application. Fill out the prompts in your terminal accordingly. When the app is done running successfully, it will log a string stating that the file was successfully created. It will be located in the `/dist` directory in the application. You can copy it from there to wherever you need it to be and edit the contents if needed.

  ## Usage
  This app is a great way to write consistent, high-quality readme files for each of your projects. After you generate a README.md file, you can always edit or make tweaks to that file to further suite your needs. For instance, if you don't yet have a link to a screenshot to add but want to add one later, you can choose the option to add a screenshot and leave the prompt blank or type something random in and then when your link is ready, you can paste it into the parenthises of the `![img]( )` generated at the bottom of the page. You may also add your screenshot or image into the `/assets/images` folder and use a relative filepath in the prompt.
